## Top Moves Tubi Should Care About

1. **Broadcast-Originated Content Remains a Streaming Powerhouse**  
   Nielsen multiplatform ratings (2025) show 'High Potential' and 'Tracker'—both broadcast-originated—dominating viewership across platforms. This underscores the continued value of broadcast content in AVOD libraries and should inform Tubi’s acquisition and programming strategies.

2. **YouTube’s Billboard Chart Exit Alters Music Streaming Metrics**  
   YouTube will no longer contribute data to the U.S. Billboard charts after January 16, 2026. This change may shift industry perceptions of digital music streaming value and could affect how AVOD platforms position music-related content.

3. **YouTube Doubles Down on Creator-Led Branded Content for Holidays**  
   YouTube’s 2025 holiday campaigns leveraged creator partnerships for branded content, highlighting its ongoing strength in influencer marketing. This intensifies competition for advertiser budgets during key seasons and may shape expectations for AVOD platforms’ brand integration capabilities.
