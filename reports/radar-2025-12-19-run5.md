## Top Moves

### 1. **Netflix Acquires Warner Bros. in $82.6B Deal**  
Netflix’s acquisition of Warner Bros. (Dec 2025) is a landmark consolidation, signaling a major shift in content pipelines, licensing, and competitive dynamics. This will likely increase competition for premium content, alter bargaining power, and accelerate industry consolidation.  
**So What:** Tubi faces heightened risk of content scarcity and rising licensing costs as major studios consolidate under tech giants.

### 2. **YouTube Secures Exclusive Oscars Streaming Rights (2029+)**  
YouTube will exclusively stream the Oscars starting in 2029, underscoring the migration of major live events to digital-first platforms.  
**So What:** Live events are increasingly locked up by tech platforms, raising the bar for AVOD differentiation and live content acquisition.

### 3. **Peacock Introduces Ads on App Launch**  
Peacock will display ads immediately upon app launch (Dec 2025), signaling a more aggressive ad strategy in streaming.  
**So What:** This could normalize more disruptive ad experiences, presenting both a competitive threat and a potential opportunity for Tubi to differentiate on ad experience.

### 4. **Apple Expands Free and Exclusive Sports Streaming**  
Apple will stream the 2025 MLS Cup for free and has secured all MLS matches starting in 2026.  
**So What:** Apple is leveraging free premium sports content to drive engagement, raising the stakes for AVOD platforms in live sports and event-based programming.
